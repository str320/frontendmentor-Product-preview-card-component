## 🔨 My Process

Setup and File Structure:

Organized the project into separate CSS files for different components (e.g., container, button).

HTML Structure:

Created the main structure using semantic HTML5 elements such as `<article>, <div>, <picture>, and <button>`.

Flexbox Layout:

Applied Flexbox for flexible and responsive layout structure.

## Styling:

Used custom properties (CSS variables) for colors, font sizes, and padding to maintain consistency.
Implemented a hover effect on the button for better user interaction.

## Responsive Design:

Used media queries to adjust the layout for mobile and desktop views.
